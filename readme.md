Project Goals
User Activity Tracking: Users log their daily activities (transportation, energy usage, diet, recycling).
Carbon Emission Calculations: Use APIs and predefined datasets to convert activities into carbon emission values (positive or negative).
Dashboard Visualization: Present users with charts and insights into their environmental impact.
Actionable Insights & Suggestions: Leverage basic ML/recommendation logic to give personalized improvement tips.
Optional Offset Integration: Allow users to connect to tree-planting or carbon offset programs through external APIs.
High-Level Architecture
Frontend (Vue.js + Tailwind CSS)

UI Framework: Vue 3 (Composition API), Tailwind for styling, Vite as build tool.
State Management: Pinia or Vuex for global state.
Routing: Vue Router for pages like Dashboard, Activities, Settings, etc.
Charting: Use Chart.js or D3.js via wrapper libraries for Vue.
Backend (Express.js)

Structure:

routes/: Define endpoints for user auth, activities, emissions calculations, suggestions, offsets.
controllers/: Business logic for each route.
models/: SQL ORM models (e.g., using Sequelize or Knex.js).
services/: For integrating external APIs and handling data retrieval.
utils/: Helper functions, caching layers, logging.
API Endpoints (Examples):

POST /auth/register: User registration
POST /auth/login: User login
POST /activities: Log user activity
GET /activities: Get user activities
GET /dashboard: Get summarized emission data & charts data
GET /suggestions: Get recommended actions
POST /offsets: Purchase carbon offsets or link to offset account
Database (SQL)

Use PostgreSQL or MySQL on AWS RDS.
Tables:
users (id, name, email, password_hash, created_at)
activities (id, user_id, type, value, date, emission_value) – type could be "car_trip", "meat_meal", "solar_usage" etc., value is the user’s input (e.g., distance traveled, kWh consumed), emission_value is calculated.
emission_factors (id, activity_type, region, emission_factor) – Maps each activity type to a known emission factor.
offsets (id, user_id, offset_amount, purchased_at)
recommendations (id, user_id, recommendation_text, created_at) – optionally store generated suggestions.
APIs & External Integrations

Carbon Emission Data: Carbon Interface API or OpenClimate API
For example, emission_factors table can be periodically updated from these APIs or fetched on-demand with caching.
Transportation & Energy Data: Electricity Maps API for local electricity emission rates.
Carbon Offset APIs: Cloverly or Pachama for linking offset purchases.
Weather API (OpenWeatherMap): Suggest eco-friendly activities based on forecast.
Hosting & Deployment

Frontend: Deploy to AWS Amplify or S3 + CloudFront.
Backend: Deploy Express.js on AWS ECS or AWS Lambda (via serverless framework) behind an API Gateway.
Database: AWS RDS (PostgreSQL).
Caching: AWS ElastiCache (Redis) for caching emission factor lookups.
Detailed Feature Planning
1. User Management and Authentication
Requirements:

Secure user authentication (JWT or session-based).
Password hashing (bcrypt).
Basic profile page (optionally store region for region-specific emission data).
Implementation Steps:

Routes: /auth/register, /auth/login, /auth/logout.
Controllers: Validate input, hash passwords, create JWT tokens.
Middleware: authMiddleware to protect routes.
Database: users table.
Frontend: A simple registration and login page with form validation.
2. Activity Logging
Requirements:

Users submit daily activities: type of transport, type of food eaten, electricity usage, recycling efforts.
Each activity entry: user ID, activity type, quantity (e.g., km driven, grams of meat), date.
Immediately calculate emissions or defer calculation until a batch job runs daily.
Implementation Steps:

Routes: POST /activities to log, GET /activities to fetch past records.
Backend Logic: On POST /activities,
Lookup emission factor from emission_factors table or call external API if not cached.
Calculate emission_value = quantity * emission_factor.
Insert into activities table.
Database: activities and emission_factors tables.
Frontend: A form to add activities (dropdown for activity type, input for quantity).
3. Emission Calculation & Dashboard
Requirements:

Visualize data (daily, weekly, monthly trends).
Pie charts for category breakdown (transport vs. diet vs. energy).
Line charts for trends over time.
Implementation Steps:

Routes: GET /dashboard returns aggregated data:
Total emissions over a time range.
Emissions grouped by category.
Positive offsets (if any).
Backend Logic:
Aggregate activities table by type over specified time range.
Summarize total carbon footprint.
Fetch user’s offset amounts and net impact.
Optionally fetch real-time emission factors if needed.
Frontend:
Create Dashboard page in Vue with charts using Chart.js.
Filters for time range (week, month).
Tailwind for layout and styling.
4. External Data APIs Integration
Requirements:

Fetch emission factors from Carbon Interface API for given activity types.
If region-specific, call Electricity Maps API for local grid emission intensity.
Weather data from OpenWeatherMap to make suggestions (e.g., “It’s sunny, try cycling”).
Implementation Steps:

services/externalApiService.js: Functions to call external APIs.
Caching: Store emission factors fetched from external APIs in emission_factors table or Redis for a certain time.
Scheduled Task (cron): Regularly update emission factor data.
Weather Data: On GET /suggestions, call weather API and incorporate weather conditions into the logic.
5. Recommendations (Basic ML/Heuristic)
Requirements:

Basic heuristic at first: If user drives a lot, suggest public transport. If high meat consumption, suggest vegetarian meals 2 days a week.
More advanced: Use past 30 days activities, find the largest emission source, recommend reduction strategy.
Implementation Steps:

Routes: GET /suggestions uses user’s activities to find improvement areas.
Backend Logic:
Identify top 2-3 activity categories by emission.
Suggest alternatives based on known emission reduction strategies.
Integrate weather data (if next few days are sunny, suggest biking).
ML Expansion (future): Could integrate a simple regression or classification model hosted on AWS Lambda for personalized suggestions.
6. Gamification and Leaderboards
Requirements:

Track user achievements (e.g., “Reduced meat consumption by 20% over a month”).
Leaderboard: Compare user’s net emission reduction with friends (requires a friend system or global leaderboard).
Implementation Steps:

Achievements:
Another table achievements or generate them on-the-fly by querying historical data.
GET /achievements endpoint.
Leaderboard:
GET /leaderboard aggregates data from activities over all users.
Requires a friends or public_users concept.
Frontend: A separate leaderboard page, badges displayed on profile.
7. Carbon Offset Integration
Requirements:

Allow users to purchase offsets via Cloverly or Pachama.
Show how much their offset reduces their net emissions.
Implementation Steps:

Routes: POST /offsets - user requests offset purchase.
Backend:
Call external API (Cloverly) with user’s purchase details.
Store transaction in offsets table.
Frontend:
A button to “Offset my emissions”, a form for amount, and a confirmation page.
Reflect offset in the dashboard net impact calculation
